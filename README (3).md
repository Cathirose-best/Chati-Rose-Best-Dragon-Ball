## Why Chrono Crystals Matter in Dragon Ball Legends

Before diving into how you can get free Chrono Crystals, letâ€™s take a moment to understand why they are so important in Dragon Ball Legends.

- **Summon New Characters**: One of the most exciting parts of Dragon Ball Legends is the character summoning system. You can summon powerful fighters like Goku, Vegeta, Frieza, and many more from the Dragon Ball universe. Chrono Crystals are required to perform these summons.
  
- **Boost Your Team**: As you progress through the game, youâ€™ll need stronger characters to compete in higher-level battles. With enough Chrono Crystals, you can acquire Z-Power to increase your charactersâ€™ power level and get them to their full potential.

- **Special Events and Upgrades**: The game regularly hosts special events where you can earn valuable rewards, including Chrono Crystals. Additionally, Chrono Crystals can be spent on upgrading your characters with new equipment or items.

Without Chrono Crystals, your progress in *Dragon Ball Legends* will be limited. Thatâ€™s why obtaining them for free is such a game-changer.
